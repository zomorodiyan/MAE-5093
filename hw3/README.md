## 1-b
# Euler
y'(x0,y0) = -2 => 0 < h < 2/|-2| = 
By running the code for different dx, I conclude that it is unstable for  dx > 0.7
# Backward Euler
It is unconditionally stable
# Trapezoidal
It is unconditionally stable
# RK2 

By running the code for different dx, I conclude that it is unstable for  dx > 0.7. (book says it should more stable than Euler but it is not)
# RK4

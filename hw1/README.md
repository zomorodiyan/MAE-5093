## Homework 1, Questions 1,2,7,8 of fundamentals of Engineering Numerical Analysis 
### Question 1 
(a) The interpolatd value at x=0.9 is 0.0235
(b) As you can see below results for the lagrange curve are too far from the
smooth real curve since it is a 20th order polynomial which meets all the 21
equaly distanced points on the smooth Runge's curve"

### Question 2 
I thought about the chain law and came up with the solution which you can see
below.

### Question 7 
(a,b,c) Becouse of large error in results I conclude that the global \
interpolation of Lagrange is not suitable for exterpolation \
and is not capable of capturing smooth curves beyond the data limits.

### Question 8 
(a) The prediction by Lagrange polynomial is way off and does not fallow the
trend of the data points at all.

(b,c) cubic spline interpolation is much closer to the real data than the
lagrange polynomial interpolation as expected. cubic spline is a local method
for interpolation afterall.
